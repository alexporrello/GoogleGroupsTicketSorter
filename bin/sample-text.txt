Question about NEX-GDDP dataset
6 posts by 3 authors  



Daneshvar, Fariborz	

May 25


Hi,

I have the following questions about NEX-GDDP dataset, available on the OPeNDAP Dataset Access Form:


- Regarding the time: this dataset is based on 365 day calendar. What would happen for leap years?

- Regarding the longitude: it ranges from 0 to 360. How does it match with longitudes ranging from -180 to +180?


Thanks for your time,

Fariborz

Hi Fariboz, 

In order to assist you I need the URL of the OPeNDAP Dataset Access Form you are viewing. 


Thanks, 

Nathan

Hi Nathan,
Here is the URL of a dateset that I mentioned before:
https://dataserver.nccs.nasa.gov/thredds/dodsC/bypass/NEX-GDDP/bcsd/rcp85/r1i1p1/pr/inmcm4.ncml.html

Thanks for your help.

Hi Fairboz, 


The dataset metadata response: 

    https://dataserver.nccs.nasa.gov/thredds/dodsC/bypass/NEX-GDDP/bcsd/rcp85/r1i1p1/pr/inmcm4.ncml.das 

Reveals some of what you asked about: 


> - Regarding the time: this dataset is based on 365 day calendar. What would happen for leap years? 

This data set appears to be the output of the BCSD model: 

>  String references "BCSD method: Thrasher et al., 2012, Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci.,16, 3309-3314. 
> Ref period obs: latest version of the Princeton Global Meteorological Forcings (http://hydrology.princeton.edu/data.php), 
> based on Sheffield et al., 2006, J. Climate, 19 (13), 3088-3111."; 

And it is possible that there are simply no leap years. Climate/Forecast models sometimes operate on a 365 day 
year to simplify the model computation. 

The metadata also contain contact information for two principles that would likely know the answer: 

>   String contact "Dr. Rama Nemani: rama....@nasa.gov, Dr. Bridget Thrasher: bri...@climateanalyticsgroup.org"; 


And I am cc’ing them in the hopes that they will chime in on your calendar question. 



> - Regarding the longitude: it ranges from 0 to 360. How does it match with longitudes ranging from -180 to +180? 
> 


The longitude metadata: 

>         String standard_name "longitude"; 
>         String long_name "longitude"; 
>         String units "degrees_east"; 
>         String axis "X"; 
>         Int32 _ChunkSizes 1440; 
> 
Indicate that the units are “degrees_east”. 

So this data set starts at 0 deg (Greenwich Line) and goes east from there. 

Datasets whose longitude spans -180 to 180 with units “degrees_east” start at the International Date Line (180 degrees West of the Greenwich Line) 



Sincerely, 

Nathan
